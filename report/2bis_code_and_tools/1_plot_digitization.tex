\subsection{Plot digitization}
Since the raw data of Legros et al. is not publicly available, we digitized the data from their
paper using a custom script extracting the data from svg exports of the figures. Digital files of
papers contain vector graphics, which encode path data for drawing lines. By reading this path data
and using some reference points to set the scale, we can extract the data points from the plot.
Doing the digitization exactly, instead of the more traditional hand-extraction, allowes us to
avoid added errors through the digitization process and streamline the data extraction for many
curves.
