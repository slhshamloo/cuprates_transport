\subsection{Cyclotron mass}
To extract the cyclotron mass from the Chambers model, we need a new approach. In contrast to the
Drude model, here we do not have the cyclotron frequency as an explicit parameter of the formula.
We cannot use the effective mass from the dispersion relation of the tight-binding model either;
It is equal to
\begin{equation}
    m^* = \hbar^2\qty(\pdv[2]{\varepsilon}{k})^{-1}
\end{equation}
and varies for different parts of the dispersion relation. In order to define a useful parameter,
we need to average over the wavevectors. So
\begin{equation}
    m_c = \frac{\hbar}{2\pi}\oint\frac{\dd{k}}{v_\perp (k)}
\end{equation}
where $v_\perp$ is the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field, on the path the charge
carriers take\footnote{This is a closed path on the Fermi surface, since the magnetic field does
not do work and the free charges are on the Fermi surface. The path is closed due to the periodic
nature of the oscillations.}
