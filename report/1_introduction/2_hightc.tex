Cuprates are a class of superconductors with high critical temperature that have been subject
to intense research since their discovery in 1986. They exhibit rich physical behavior, specially
in their various phases.

The crystal structure of cuprates is a perovskite structure, with a copper-oxygen plane
($\mathrm{CuO}_2$) as the main conducting layer. This structure is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cuprate_structure}. You can think of cuprates as a stack of different conducting layers,
so the electronic properties of cuprates are mainly 2D. However, the interlayer coupling is
non-negligible, and the 3D nature of cuprates is important for their physical properties.

The phase diagram of cuprates is shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase_diagram}. The main phases of
cuprates are the Antiferromagnetic (AF) phase, the metallic phase, the Pseudogap (PG) phase,
the Superconducting (SC) phase. The metallic phase itself can be split into a strange metal
phase (with anamolous electronic scattering properties) and a normal metal phase (with
well-described conductivity, using Fermi liquid theory). There is also a hypothesised point in the
phase diagram called the quantum critical point, marked as $p^*$ in the figure.
