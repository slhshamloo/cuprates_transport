\subsection{Origin of Cuprate Superconductivity:\\The Quantum Critical Point}
The origin of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates is still the subject of intense
research and debate, but a possible explanation has to do with the Quantum Critical Point (QCP).
The QCP is a point in the phase diagram of a material where there is a phase transition at zero
temperature. This phase transition is driven by quantum fluctuations, hence the name. This phase
transition could lead to inteeractions that generate supercunductivity In the case of
cuprates, this is a critical doping level, usually denoted by $p_c$ or $p^*$. The actual existence
of a QCP for cuprates is still a matter of debate and it is the subject of this project.

In their 2019 paper, Michon et al.\cite{michon2019} used specific heat measurements to
show the existence of the QCP. The effective mass of the charge carriers is expected to diverge at
the QCP, and the effective mass is proportional to $C/T$ where $C$ is the specific heat attributed
to the charge carriers and $T$ is the temperature. So, to probe the QCP, Michon et al. measured
the specific heat at very low temperatures (1 to 2 K) and extrapolated to zero temperature. They
showed that the specific heat increases dramatically and peaks at the critical doping level
(Figure \ref{fig:michon}), which is a signature of a QCP.

The reason this divergence is expected is that the specific heat is related
to entropy, which is maximal at such a phase transition. This is because the phase transition is a
maximally disordered state, due to loss of scale (i.e. large correlation lengths) and high
fluctuations.\footnote{Again, this is related to loss of scale, but a deeper discussion of phase
transitions is beyond the scope of this report.}
