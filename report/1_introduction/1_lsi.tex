\section{Introduction \& Problem Statement}

We carried out our project under the supervision of Prof. Gaël Grissonnanche in his group at \textit{Laboratoire des Solides Irradiés} (Laboratory for Irradiated Solids, LSI). 
The LSI is a joint research unit of CNRS, CEA and École polytechnique, hosted on École polytechnique's campus.
It notably hosts an electron irradiator used by researchers worldwide to add controlled disorder to materials ranging from cements in nuclear power plants to satellite photovoltaics and quantum materials.

The group's research focuses on the study of quantum materials under extreme temperature and magnetic field conditions. 
Their laboratory consists of two refrigerators that can go from room temperature to near absolute zero ($\sim 10$ millikelvin).
These refrigerators are equipped with a large superconducting magnet, 
each capable of operating at up to 14 teslas.

As our project was numerical (leveraging published experimental data),  
we didn't carry out experiments using this equipment and were supervised by Prof. Grissonnanche only.
