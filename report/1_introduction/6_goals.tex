During our project, we gradually set and met the following goals. In particular, we achieved to : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item develop a tool to extract data from graphs published in the literature;
	\item reproduce the fitting results of the papers we extracted the data from;
	\item develop a tool to calculate a better model (Chambers' formula) by adapting existing code used for other experiments;
	\item analytically compare the two models (Drude and Chambers') and show that the latter reduces to the former under a 'free electron' hypothesis;
	\item validate the new numerical method by comparing calculated numerical results in the 'free electron' hypothesis with the Drude model;
	\item develop a fitting tool leveraging the new code, existing packages;
	\item qualitatively analyse (explore) the parameter space to prepare fitting;
	\item perform the fits and find the best fitting protocol, on one sample.
\end{itemize}

Due to a lack of time, we were not able, as of the writing of this report, to :
\begin{itemize}
	\item extract the parameters that would reveal or deny the existence of criticality;
	\item perform the procedure on all samples to conclude.
\end{itemize}
