\subsection{Goals}
During our project, we gradually set and met the following goals. In particular, we succeeded to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\done] develop a tool to extract data from graphs published in the literature;
	\item[\done] reproduce the fitting results of the papers we extracted the data from;
	\item[\done] develop a tool to calculate a better model (Chambers' formula) by adapting existing code used for other experiments;
	\item[\done] analytically compare the two models (Drude and Chambers') and show that the latter reduces to the former under a 'free electron' hypothesis;
	\item[\done] validate the new numerical method by comparing calculated numerical results in the 'free electron' hypothesis with the Drude model;
	\item[\done] develop a fitting tool leveraging the new code, existing packages;
	\item[\done] qualitatively analyze (explore) the parameter space to prepare fitting;
	\item[\done] perform the fits and find the best fitting protocol on one data from one doping level.
	\item[\done] repeat the fitting on data from other doping levels.
	\item[\done] extract the effective mass from the fitting results.
	\item[\done] compare the results with the literature.
\end{itemize}
Due to a lack of time, we were not able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\emptybox] do rigorous error analysis;
	\item[\emptybox] make a more complex model for lower doping levels;
\end{itemize}
